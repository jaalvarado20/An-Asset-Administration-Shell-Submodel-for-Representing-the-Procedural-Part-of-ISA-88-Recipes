# An-Asset-Administration-Shell-Submodel-for-Representing-the-Procedural-Part-of-ISA-88-Recipes
This repository presents the rule files for the detection of insecure and unreachable networks, as well as the file of its implementation in USE. Likewise, it presents the .aasx file generated in the implementation performed in the AASX Package Explorer tool.

**Procedure for the detection of unreachable networks.**
1. Make sure you have the latest version of USE installed, which can be found at the following link: https://github.com/useocl/use/blob/master/INSTALL
2. Open the specification contained in the file "SFC Model -Rules".
3. Open the .soil file

4. Upload the file layout

5. You will be able to visualize the example of the unreachable network

**The same procedure applies for the example of insecure networks.**

To view the .AASX file generated in the implementation, you must install the AASX Package Explorer tool, which you can download from the following link https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/package-explorer/releases

Open "Crema Dental" file
